                            Plants are those organisms that possess photosynthesis, cell walls, spores and more or less sedimentary behavior.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Botany</strong> is the study of most organisms traditionally treated as plants, including virtually all
                            eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms (land plants and the several groups of algae) plus other eukaryotic
                            organisms with cell walls and spores.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To study plants scientifically we have to assume that all biological phenomena can be explained by the laws of physics. It
                            is not possible to calculate plant function from it structure using first principles alone.

                        Secondary metabolites are a diverse array of organic compounds that appear not to have a direct function in plant growth.
                        They have a restricted distribution within the plant kingdom, they are found in only one plant or
                        in a restricted group of plants.

                        These molecules often have an important economical value. They can be identified and purified and their chemical structure
                        is known.

                        <strong>Plant systematics</strong> is a science that includes and encompases traditional taxonomy, the description,
                        identification nomenclature and classification of organisms, that has as its primary goal the reconstruction
                        of phylogeny on the evolutionary history of life(1).
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        We classify plants and try understand the relations between the vast diversity of plants with plant systematics. While studying
                        plant systematics you will discover that species have adopted the same basic principles in order to continue
                        their existence.

                        <strong>Examples </strong> Enzymes and nucle√Øc acids are used by all living species. Cellulose, starch and chlorophyl
                        are molecular component used by all plants.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        It is thus possible to identify molecules that have significant consequences for plant function or that have an important
                        economical or practical use. We can calculate the properties of these molecules directly from the law
                        of physics using first principles alone.

                        Plant physiology is a science that studies the relation between molecular mechanisms and the function and behavoir of larger
                        plant structure like plant tissues.

                        Systematics, plant physiology and biochemistry are three major areas of biological science where quantumbiochemistry can

                        There are many more biological sciences some are more specialized ( e.g. cell biology, genetics, plant root science ) others
                        are focussed on applications (e.g. plant nutrition, medical plant) still other focus on the application
                        of mathematics ( e.g. biomathematics).
